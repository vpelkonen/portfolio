# My home website

Hi there! You're looking at the website I made to sell myself online. Pretty neat, huh? It's not much but it's honest work.

The website is made with [Gatsby](https://gatsby.com) and hosted in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

In case you're looking for my CV, the closest to that is my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/vpelkonen). Otherwise, drop a line at [vepelkonen@gmail.com](mailto:vepelkonen@gmail.com).

Go ahead, copy the code if you like!
